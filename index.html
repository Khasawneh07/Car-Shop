    The 2021 GT-R's standard twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-6 makes a mighty 565 horsepower. 
    It hooks up to a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive that conspire to put all that power to the pavement. 
    At our test track, the GT-R launched itself from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.9 seconds. 
    The GT-R's quick steering, rigid structure, and adjustable suspension can make even amateurs feel positively heroic from behind the wheel. 
    Want more? Check out the Track Edition and NISMO models with a tuned-up engine that makes 600 horsepower. 
    The ride is firm but not punishing and, thanks to active sound cancellation, the thrum of the GT-R's engine doesn't punish your ear drums when cruising on the highway.
